# Scenario
You’ve joined a mid-sized SaaS company as a Principal Data Scientist.

The product team is concerned about user churn and wants to understand:

* Why users are leaving
* How to predict churn before it happens
* What actions can improve retention
* You may use AI-generated or synthetic data for this exercise.

## Objective
You are expected to lead the analysis and modeling effort as an individual contributor,
while also demonstrating how you would mentor a junior team member through this project.

## Project Components

### Part 1: Problem Framing

* Define the business problem
* Propose success metrics
* Identify risks and assumptions

### Part 2: Data Exploration & Feature Engineering

* Perform EDA
* Engineer predictive features
* Document your rationale

### Part 3: Predictive Modeling

Build a churn prediction model
* Justify algorithm choice
* Evaluate performance
* Address class imbalance, data leakage, and interpretability

### Part 4: Strategic Recommendations

* Present 2–3 actionable insights
* Discuss testing approaches

### Part 5: Mentorship & Scalability

* Explain how you’d mentor a junior team member
* Outline high-level deployment architecture
* Describe how you’d monitor model performance

Deliverables:
* Python Script: Clean, modular, and well-documented
* Executive Summary: 5–7 slides or 1–2 pages (PDF or slides)
* GitHub Repo: Include a README
